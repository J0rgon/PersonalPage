export const beginning = "You're probably wondering, who is this guy? To be fair, I'm not entirely sure either, but I will try to explain. First and foremost, nice to meet you! (poor soul to stumble upon this page). My name's Jorge. I'm a twenty year old student from El Salvador (the world's coolest dictatorship btw). I'm a third year computer engineering student (homeless shelter 2032 let's go). I'm currently trying to be more comfortable with who I am, and doing kind of like and autobiography crossed my mind and I thought it could be a cool thing to do (maybe derust my web dev skills if they're still there, and I don' know about graphical design, so don't be too harsh if this looks wanky). If you want to reach out, there's information at the end, if not, you can still read about me (how cool is that?), only if you want to of course :>";
