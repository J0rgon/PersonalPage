export const beginning = "You're probably wondering, who is this guy? To be fair, I'm not entirely sure either, but I will try to explain. First and foremost, nice to meet you! (poor soul to stumble upon this page). My name's Jorge. I'm a twenty year old student from El Salvador (the world's coolest dictatorship btw). I'm a third year computer engineering student (homeless shelter 2032 let's go). I'm currently trying to be more comfortable with who I am, and doing kind of like an autobiography crossed my mind and I thought it could be a cool thing to do (maybe derust my web dev skills if they're still there, plus I don't know about graphical design, so don't be too harsh if this looks wanky). If you want to reach out, there's information at the end, if not, you can still read about me (how cool is that?), only if you want to of course :>";

export const present = "We're in big 2025 now, what am I currently doing (or at least trying to)? Well, as I said in the beginning I'm a third year computer engineering student, so make it to fourth year without failing any classes is a big objective this year, as it has been these past two years I've already finished. I recently got back at the gym after over a year of not going. I did some cardio here and there, but not much else in 2024. As you would guess from a student like me, I'm a big fan of videogames. I want to get all achievements in Persona 5, Persona 4 and Persona 3. Gaming wise, I don't anything else planned right now. Another big thing for me is that I have to make friends, or at least acquaintances, as I've always been very shy, I have a really hard time socializing. Even though things are going good so far in that regard, I do still feel lonely at times. That's where I'm right now, maybe I'll update this and keep it up to date, or maybe I'll forget and this becomes a time capsule >:o, who knows?";

export const future = "Future? There's no future for this world... but for real? Who knows? It just looked cooler if I had past, present and future in the top buttons, so I put this here :] But there are some things I do hope for. Being healthier, improving my social and 'hard' skills, smelling better, getting cooler clothing... oh right! Finishing my degree, getting a job and find out what it's actually to be a human being that participates in society. Thanks for reading! ILY"
